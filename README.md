This project introduces an automated approach to Statistical Passing-by Measurement, combining modern technologies to streamline the process. Traditionally, this measurement required manual intervention, where an operator had to manually register each passing vehicle. However, our solution automates data collection and analysis using computer vision techniques, reducing human error and increasing efficiency.

The system consists of a comprehensive application developed using Python, leveraging several key technologies including Tkinter for the graphical user interface, Matplotlib for real-time data visualization, and serial communication for data acquisition from speed radar and sound level meter devices.

In its current state, the application provides real-time display of speed and sound level data, allowing operators to monitor passing vehicles. However, the crucial step of registering each passing vehicle still requires manual intervention, where an operator presses a button to initiate the measurement process.

To address this limitation, we have developed a sophisticated AI algorithm that employs computer vision techniques to automatically detect and register passing vehicles. By analyzing video footage, the AI algorithm identifies vehicles passing through the measurement zone, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This breakthrough enables the system to autonomously carry out Statistical Passing-by Measurements, significantly enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
